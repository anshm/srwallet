This is a smart contract that acts as a wallet and stores funds for a user on the ethereum blockchain. The motive behind this smart contract is to protect a user from loss of funds if private key is lost. If the owner loses their private key, guardian aacounts can arrive at consensus to reassign ownership to another account owned by the same user.

The smart contract is available in this repository along with a slidedeck explaining the functionality of this smart contract along with some theoretical background.
